Use a whimsical, playful cartoon style inspired by Toca Boca. Apply a flat design aesthetic with clean lines, thick black outlines, and minimal gradients. Incorporate pastel-friendly tones and soft shading to suggest depth without realism. Shapes should be slightly exaggerated and child-friendly, with symmetrical or fan-like arrangements where appropriate. The overall mood should be imaginative, approachable, and suitable for a mobile game interface or character-driven scene. Background must be transparent unless otherwise specified.
